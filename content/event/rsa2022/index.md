summary: At the 2022 RSA conference, I organized a roundtable discussion on our Team Science individual participant data meta-analysis.
abstract: 'We recently conducted a meta-analysis on the daily association between affect and alcohol use in diary and EMA studies. The results of these analyses sparked a lot of discussion among the research team of more than sixty collaborators. At this roundtable, six collaborators will come together and discuss their takeaways from the project and how we should study affect-regulation models of alcohol use going forward.'
