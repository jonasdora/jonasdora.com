abstract: Test whether global self-reports of urgency moderated the within-person associations of affect and impulsive behaviors. Negative urgency is a personality trait that is a risk factor for arange of psychopathology. Although it is assumed that global self-reports of urgency measure individual tendencies to act more impulsively in the face of negative emotions, evidence from ecological momentary assessment studies is mixed. In this Registered Report, we used ecological momentary assessment data from a large sample of young adults (n = 496, age 18â€“22, 5 surveys per day for 40 days). All forms of momentary impulsivity were impaired in moments when people reported more intense negative emotions, but global self-reports of urgency did not explain individual differences in this association. Moreover, averaged affective states, rather than specific dimensions, affective circumplex, orappraisals, best predicted impulsive states. Results suggest that face-valid interpretations of global self-reportof urgency are inaccurate, and it may be important to understand how some people come to understand themselves as high on urgency rather than assuming that people's self-reports of their motivations are accurate. Momentary experiences of emotions globally impact multiple weakly to moderately associated impulsive behaviors, and future research should seek to understand both when and for whomthese associations are strongest.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This EMA study suggests that people are more impulsive in moments high in negative emotions, but this association is not moderated by global reports of negative urgency.
