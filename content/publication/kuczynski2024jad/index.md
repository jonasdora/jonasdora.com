abstract: Evidence suggests that loneliness causes people to feel more depressed. It is unknown, however, why this association occurs and whether momentary versus chronic experiences of loneliness are implicated. Theoretical accounts suggest that momentary feelings of loneliness produce two competing motivations: social reaffiliation and social withdrawal. Social affiliation is protective against depression; social withdrawal, in contrast, is a risk factor. Thus, engaging in frequent and high-quality interactions following experiences of loneliness may protect against subsequent depression. We tested this hypothesis using a random-interval experience sampling design (5x/day/day, 14 days; Nobs = 6568) with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adults with elevated depression symptoms (N = 102). Momentary loneliness was associated with depressed mood at the same time point and ∼2.5h and ∼5h later. Frequency and quality of social interaction did not moderate these associations. Findings suggest that momentary feelings of loneliness may be an important target for clinical intervention.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Experiences of loneliness predict depressive symptoms prospectively for about 5 hours in daily life, but this association is not moderated by frequency and quality of social interaction.
