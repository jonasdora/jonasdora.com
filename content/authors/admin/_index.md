## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington. Most of my recent work is focused on understanding the affect regulation function of alcohol and cannabis use, and the contribution of this function to the etiology of substance use disorders. I approach this topic with a combination of experimental and intensive longitudinal research designs. This work is being funded by the NIH and has led to publications (among others) in Psychological Bulletin, Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, and Clinical Psychological Science. I am also interested in quantitative methods (e.g., Bayesian mixed-effects modeling) and formal theorizing and modeling. In my projects, I emphasize collaboration and work closely together with colleagues in the US, Europe, and Asia. I am also committed to making research more transparent and openly accessible and I adopt an Open Science workflow in all my projects. I am a consulting editor at Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, Clinical Psychological Science, and Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science.
